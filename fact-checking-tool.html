              Fake news and misinformation can take many forms, so providing
              tools that address different cases is essential. These tools need
              to present evidence to help determine whether something is real or
              not, but they can’t simply give a yes-or-no answer. That’s why
              human evaluation remains necessary. At the same time, we had to
              consider that the end users are journalists, often without a
              technical background, who need to understand how the tools work in
              order to trust them and confidently use them in their reporting.

              We focused on improving the most frequently used tools and adding
              new functionalities to better support journalists’ workflows. The
              redesign covered the Image Forensic tool, the GIF Comparator, and
              Twitter Analysis. We introduced clearer explanations, enhanced
              usability, and improved visual feedback, all without compromising
              speed or overwhelming users. A key priority was making the
              technology’s inner workings more transparent to build user trust,
              while maintaining a fast and efficient experience for both expert
              and beginner users. Additionally, we delivered a general UI
              redesign to modernize the app’s overall look and feel.

              The forensic tool is one of the most important features of the
              app. It allows journalists to detect alterations in images that
              could have been used to spread misinformation. However, the
              algorithms or filters used to identify these alterations are not
              100% accurate and can sometimes produce false positives. This,
              combined with the complexity of explaining how they work,
              presented several challenges that we aimed to address with the
              following features.

                  >Interactive presentation of results.</span
                ><br />All filters were displayed together, and to compare them
                with the original image, users simply had to hover over each one
                to see the affected areas highlighted in the original image.
                This helped them easily identify regions that might have been
                altered.

                  >Clear and informative entry point.</span
                ><br />The tool’s entry point was designed to be as
                user-friendly and informative as possible, setting expectations
                and clearly communicating its limitations.

                  >Contextual explanations and guidance.</span
                ><br />Next to each filter, we provided information such as
                detection scale, explanations of how the filters work, and tips
                for identifying real versus false positives. This helped
                journalists make informed decisions and include any necessary
                context in their reports.

              Once alterations were identified, journalists needed a tool to
              display the results in a clear and visual way. Simply showing the
              original and altered images side by side, or highlighting the
              altered area, was often not effective, if the alteration was
              subtle, it could be difficult to spot the differences. That’s why
              we introduced the GIF Comparator Tool, which allowed journalists
              to upload the original and altered images, and automatically
              generated a GIF that overlapped both, switching between them every
              few seconds and showing only the altered part. This proved
              especially useful for their web reports, as they could publish the
              GIF and allow readers to easily see the detected alterations.

              Twitter is often a place where a lot of misinformation is created
              and shared. However, when a tweet becomes popular, a large volume
              of comments and related content is generated, and Twitter does not
              provide tools to easily analyse all that information. That’s why
              we introduced the Twitter Analysis Tool, where journalists could
              simply paste the link to a tweet and receive a detailed analysis.
              Insights such as the types of comments people were posting, the
              most active users, and the links being shared helped journalists
              examine the conversation and identify any false information that
              other users might have already pointed out.

              Other more experimental tools were also developed. Deepfakes have
              become a new trend in fake news and misinformation, and they are
              very difficult to detect because the entire image is AI-generated,
              making it nearly impossible to spot alterations using traditional
              forensic tools designed for manual edits. However, some
              experimental algorithms became available, and we provided an
              easy-to-use tool to explore them for both images and videos.

              Foreign languages can also be a challenge for journalists,
              especially when they involve different alphabets, and extracting
              text for translation becomes difficult when it’s embedded in
              images where it can’t be easily copied. To address this, we
              developed an OCR tool specialised in translations. The tool
              detects any kind of text in an image, attempts to identify the
              language, provides the extracted text in plain format for easy
              copying, and suggests a translation into a preferred language.
              This greatly streamlined the process of analyzing this type of
              information for journalists.
