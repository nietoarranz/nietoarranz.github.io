            <div class="txt-sect-subtitle notfirst">understanding of the context of use</div>
            <div class="txt-sec-text">In this first stage, we tried to understand how the users manage their time to accomplish their student-life tasks, such as project assignments, time to study, or even simple homework tasks, besides sports. We selected sports as a complementary activity because is a typical interest that we discovered that a lot of students have.<br>‍<br>For this process, we differentiated two target groups, students that practice sports alone and students that practice sports in teams. We believed that this differentiation could be interesting because we could study how can vary the process of time management when the organization of an activity depends on more than one person.<br><br>Five people of each target group participated in the study. For each of them, an interview with open-ended questions was conducted. These interviews were semi-structured, and notes and no verbal information were captured by members of the project in each interview. After analyzing the results, the next insights were extracted.</div>
            <div class="txt-sec-text list">1. The students need a flexible tool for time management that can combine academic responsibilities and free-time activities.</div>
            <div class="txt-sec-text list">2. The students like to follow a healthy lifestyle and are open to invest time in activities that allow them to achieve it.<br></div>
            <div class="txt-sec-text list">3. The students need to coordinate with other people for some group activities.<br></div>

            <div class="txt-sec-text">After defining the insights, a study over them was conducted.

            <div class="txt-sec-text notfirst">After it, in the prototype design, two phases were addressed, in the first one, we designed of low fidelity, and when this prototype was validated by a tutor expert in the field, a high fidelity version was created.<br> <br>Two versions of the system were designed in each phase. One was a tablet application version. The reason to choose this device was that a tablet is the device that is more similar to a classic board that you can put on a wall and touch to move notes or post-its.</div>
