This registration of participation is notified to the students to make them known that the participation that they did was being taken into consideration.

As we don’t want to overload with work to the professor we give them the decision of how to treat these questions, they can answer each of them or they can simply take into consideration the participation of the students and then answer all of them during the beginning of the next session.</div>
